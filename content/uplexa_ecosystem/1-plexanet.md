Plexanet is an onion routing protocol much to that of TOR, additionally with much greater speeds. PlexaNet will be powered by [**Utility Nodes**](/uplexa_pos/), like masternodes, but with exit node capability. In order to sustain high speeds, our network incentivizes Utility Node operators by paying out dividends in form of partial block rewards.
