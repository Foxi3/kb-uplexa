uPlexa is the first digital currency designed around complete IoT ubiquity. The underlying core functionality of this project, is to provide an incentive to IoT users to mint coins (smart phones, smart TVs, kitchen appliances, vehicles, etc). By focusing on IoT devices, this will allow the uPlexa network to become one of the most decentralised digital currencies. However, thatâ€™s far from where this project ends.
