| ‚ö†Ô∏è TESTNET STAGE üõ†  |
|---------------------|

![Steadfast Storm Testnet](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*GsI8l5iL3M3Nm1ipdfmfiQ.png)

On 31st December 2020, uPlexa project officially release **"Steadfast Storm"** code on the Testnet.

# Utility Node

Steadfast Storm enables Utility Nodes (UNs).  
UNs are like master nodes in the terms of providing proof-of-stake transactional validation. However, UNs are more complex, using PoU (proof-of-utility) in order to provide the backbones infrastructure for our decentralized privacy network (dVPN) known as Plexanet. PlexaNet will release in Alpha (on testnet) in January, 2021.

# Requirements
There are certain requirements for Utility Node as we want to ensure quality and reliablity of the nodes.

### Mainnet

- Total Stake: 2,000,000 UPX for Solo Node _or_ 500,000 UPX for Shared Node
- Virtual Machine Requirements:
    - Min 1-2 vCPU
    - Min 2GB of RAM
    - Min 13Mbps connection speed
    - 99.999% Uptime (or risks losing out on rewards)

> **_NOTE:_** We do not recommend using AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure to deploy your VM.

### Testnet

- Total Stake: 20,000 Testnet UPX for Solo Node _or_ 5,000 Testnet UPX for Shared Node
- Virtual Machine Requirements:
    - All specification will be the same as Mainnet but you are welcome to deploy the testnet on any devices capable of compiling the Steadfast Storm code.

# Testnet Setup Guide (Ubuntu 18.04)

### TO-DO
- [ ] List of tested hosting
- [ ] simple video of deploying a VM and initial setup.
- [ ] tutorial on running node using screen


> We recommend using Ubuntu 18.04 or latest version for beginners and less technical user. As such, our setup guides will be based on Ubuntu 18.04 system. You may refer to our Github for compile instruction for other distros.

### Step 1: Create Your Virtual Machine and Run Initial Setup
Deploy your VM with your favourite hosting services and run initial system update and upgrade.
```
sudo apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Pull uPlexa Core Bundle (Steadfast Storm) from Official Github Repo

Run the following command to pull uPlexa Core Bundle to your VM or server:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/uPlexa/uplexa
```
Navigate to uplexa directory and initiate & update submodule:
```
cd uplexa && git submodule init && git submodule update
```

### Step 3: Installed Required Libraries and Dependencies
In order to compile uPlexa, install dependencies libraries and tool required for the compilation:  
```
sudo apt install git build-essential cmake pkg-config libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libzmq3-dev libunbound-dev libsodium-dev libpgm-dev -y
```  
More details summaries of the libraries and tools can be found here:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`https://github.com/uplexa/uplexa#dependencies`

### Step 4: Compile 
Testnet is compile on master branch of uPlexa repo:
```
git checkout master
```
Compile the code:
```
make release
```

Note: If the code compile stuck or running too slow, you may need to create /swapfile.  
You may refer to `https://linuxize.com/post/create-a-linux-swap-file/`

### Step 5: Start Daemon in Utility Node
The resulting executable can be found at `$ ~/uplexa/build/Linux/master/release/bin`  
Navigate to the folder:
```
cd ~/uplexa/build/Linux/master/release/bin
```
Start daemon in Utility Node mode and let it sync. This may take several hours (much quicker on testnet):
> **_Note:_** You can start daemon in background using --detach mode, or use screen

```
./uplexad --testnet --utility-node
```
> _Optional:_ Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/uplexa/build/Linux/master/release/bin"` to .profile and then run uPlexa Node with
```
uplexad --testnet --utility-node
```

### Step 6: Create Testnet Wallet

Create testnet wallet to get wallet address for staking:
```
./uplexa-wallet-cli --testnet
```
Follow the instructions and save the 25-mnemonic seed word to restore the wallet later if needed. 

### Step 7: Register Utility Node
Back to your daemon, you may now register your Utility Node to the network:
```
register_node
```
Follow the instructions.

| ‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION   |
|---------------|

- Select NO for auto-staking until we patch the code. **Latest update:** auto-staking option is disabled.
- For Manual Staking (in testnet), the locking period is 2 days (1440 block). You need to re-staking (re-register the Utility Node) upon expiry.
- to check your expiry height, run `print_un_status` in the daemon. Check Expiry Height (block) or Expiry Date (Estimated in UTC).

Once complete, you will receive a code in which must be pasted into the wallet client.  
Paste the code you were provided by the daemon to the uplexa-wallet-cli, and agree to the TX fee.  

| ‚úÖ SUCCESS |
|------------|

You are now set up! You should start receiving block rewards coming in every couple minutes.  
Run `show_transfers` to see your incoming transfers from the uplexa-wallet-cli marked _unode._

# Shared Node

### Node Operator

For Node Operator, `register_node` and follow the instructions:
- Will the operator contribute the entire stake (solo staking)? (Y/Yes/N/No): **No**
- What percentage of the staking reward would the operator like to reserve as an operator fee (0-100)%: **10** _(Choose desired reward percentage for the Node Operator i.e:10%)_
- How much uplexa will the operator reserve in the staking operation? **5000** _(Min staking is 5000 UPX)_
- Do you wish to reserve portions of the stake for other specific contributors? (Y/Yes/N/No): **No**
    - Select **_No_** - if you don't want to reserve staking positions. The shared node will be open to anyone to contribute their stake to your node.
    - Select **_Yes_** - node operator will be able to reserve the staking position by providing the contributor wallet address and amount when prompted.

Continue to follow the instructions, and you will receive a code in which must be pasted into the node operator's wallet client.  
Paste the code you were provided by the daemon to the uplexa-wallet-cli, and agree to the TX fee.

### Node Contributor

Once the node operator successfully register the node to the network, the reserved contributor then can proceed to provide the staking amount in the `uplexa-wallet-cli` by using the following command:
```
stake <utility_node_pubkey> <contributors_wallet_add> <staking_amount>
Example:
stake 821f636ee49ef3d7eb3790b9ecf641c0399cb60511f0b3f4fd1c17f51664315c UPTzc6QFexU9fcRG55gLAcAqPDXJVSfKPK3RjLbhr1FkM6jkoFBp3BnF18moYfbEyFL9z8M4iFJ69bdoWcaJ75pLHGXRiegG87f 5000
```
> **_Note:_** Node operator can get the Utility Node Public Key by using command `print_un_key` in the utility node daemon.

Once all the contributors already stake their portion, the node will automatically registered to the uPlexa Networks.
