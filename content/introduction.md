uPlexa uses a modified version of Monero's blockchain consensus system to create a peer-to-peer electronic payment system focused on harnessing the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and anonymity. These range from enabling complete anonymity for e-commerce stores and consumers to providing IoT devices with rewards for acting as the backbone of the network.

uPlexa supports both anonymous transactions and anonymous store owners, because we disapprove of the storage and sale of personal information for marketing and all other purposes. uPlexa supports multiple programming languages with powerful API integrations and we have developed ready-to-install plugin for many popular ecommerce platforms for you to use.

uPlexa providing a very powerful alternative to traditional payment processors such as Stripe and PayPal. These traditional services have high fees, slow transactions, and they may hold your funds for months at a time with absolutely no support. This stunts the merchant's growth, since they are not able to reinvest that held-up money into advertising or some other area of their business.

**uPlexa Ecosystem** is powered by collective power of the Internet of Things (IoT) harnessed into a single decentralized network. Each node on our network is incentivized to provide a portion of their CPU power. Our core objective is to generate a profitable amount of uPlexa for nodes to help pay for the electricity costs involved in running the IoT device.

Just like in other areas of uPlexa, the IoT mining network puts the power into the hands of the people. You can choose how much of your CPU is utilized. uPlexa will eventually have mining software for nearly every IoT device out there, and even if software is not available for your device, you can mine on the web without having to download any extra resources.

# uPlexa Community

We are **NOT** individual or corporation, we are a **Community of Collective Ideas & Privacy Advocates**.  
The complete decentralization of uPlexa is our ultimate goal, while the core intentions of uPlexa is to allow for anonymity, privacy, and overall individual freedom. Unfortunately, there are large corporations, malicious actors, and agencies looking to disrupt and disable anonymous based payment services like ours, and that is why we need you, the community of consumers, merchants, IoT device users, and contributors to help us to accomplish this magnificent vision.
