# CPU Mining - Introduction

CPU mining is a process that utilizes cores of a Central Processing Unit (CPU) to verify transaction on the uPlexa blockchain. A CPU is a part of computer that provides computing power for execution of operations performed by software installed on that computer. If you have a computer, chances are you will be able to mining uPlexa.

# CPU Mining - Mining Software

There are few mining software that supported uPlexa Algorithm that are available in Windows, Linux and MacOS.

- **XMRig-UPX** - XMRig-UPX is a high performance uPlexa (UPX) CPU miner, with official support for Windows and Linux. Originally based on cpuminer-multi with heavy optimizations/rewrites and removing a lot of legacy code, since version 1.0.0 completely rewritten from scratch on C++.
- **XMRigCC** - XMRigCC is a high performance RandomX, CryptoNight, Argon2 and AstroBWT CPU miner for support for Windows, Linux and MacOS.
