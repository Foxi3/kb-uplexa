uPlexa is the first digital currency designed around complete IoT ubiquity. The underlying core functionality of this project, is to provide an incentive to IoT users to mint coins (smart phones, smart TVs, kitchen appliances, vehicles, etc). By focusing on IoT devices, this will allow the uPlexa network to become one of the most decentralised digital currencies.

uPlexa is designed around complete IoT ubiquity. The underlying core functionality of this project, is to provide an incentive to IoT users to mint coins. With uPlexa's efficient algorithm to boost IoT hashing power, our first proved concept of IoT mining is realized with the release of uPlexa Android Miner.
